The mission of this project is to develop and implement a robotic system, "Novicole," capable of autonomously navigating within a poultry farm. The robot will be equipped with four control boards, each managed by a GD32F130 processor, responsible for controlling brushless motors that drive the robot’s movement. 
Initially, the navigation of the robot was controlled using an ESP32, which handled the robot's movement and sensor data. However, the system was later enhanced by integrating the GD32F130 processors and utilizing ROS (Robot Operating System) for more precise and efficient navigation. 
ROS provides a robust framework for managing the communication between the various control boards, sensors, and motors, ensuring the safety of the poultry while optimizing the robot’s operational efficiency in the farm environment.
